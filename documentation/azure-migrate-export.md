# Azure Migrate Explore (now with an AI Assistant)

## What is Azure Migrate Explore?
Azure Migrate Explore is a utility package that uses Azure Migrate discovery and assessment information from an existing Azure Migrate project to generate a comprehensive presentation for executives. The utility allows users to customize discovered data, assessment output, and the visualization layer of the presentation by using Microsoft tools such as Excel, Power BI, and PowerPoint/PDF on Edge to accommodate desired customizations.

Additionally, Azure Migrate Explore now includes an AI assistant to help create seller summaries and interact with users for more insights about Azure Migrate, migration strategies, understanding TCO, and right-sized target calculations. The AI can update the seller summaries with new data.
Azure Migrate Explore (AME) is a centralized and scalable solution that provides a consistent estimate of costs to support the customer’s decision-making process for migrating to Azure.
## What’s New in Version 4.0?
- Azure Migrate explore now has an AI assistant that can help you create a seller-oriented summary that can be used as talk track with the presentation, and you can converse with the AI to find answers to your questions regarding migration of your/your customer’s workloads to Azure.
- Azure Migrate Explore now supports inventory discovered by both appliance as well as CMDB/RvTools based import.
- Azure Migrate Explore can help you create a quick dedicated AVS report  

## How to get Azure Migrate Explore Utility Package?
Users can download the Azure Migrate Explore utility from https://aka.ms/azuremigrateexport.

The link downloads a .zip file. Extract the contents of the package.

The Package consists of three files:
- Azure-Migrate-Explore.exe is a light-weight console app that facilitates running of discovery and assessment and helps fetch data from Azure Migrate discovery and assessment APIs.
- The PSScripts folder consists of underlying PowerShell modules.
- The PowerBI template helps build a cohesive presentation on top of discovery and assessment reports generated after running Azure-Migrate-Explore.exe.
The Azure Migrate Explore Utility is hosted on an open source github repository. Users can access all versions of this utility package from https://aka.ms/azuremigrateexportutility. Users can use the script to build on top of current solutions.

## How does Azure Migrate Explore Work?
The discovery module of the utility package runs to pull discovered data from an already deployed Azure Migrate Project using Azure Migrate APIs. Users can then customize the discovery output for assessment. [Learn More](#how-to-customize-discovery-report) about customization on discovery file.

The assessment module of utility package uses Azure Migrate assessment APIs to run PaaS preferred assessments for in scope machines. Machines that cannot be migrated to PaaS target are assessed for IaaS targets. [Learn More](#azure-migrate-export-assessment-report-generation-logic) about AME assessment logic. The assessment module generates Assessment Core Report, Assessment Opportunity report and Clash Report. 

Users can customize the generated Assessment Core report by referring to the details in the Clash report to get rid of duplicates. This helps the user to generate presentation and cost estimates of only the required target assessments. [Learn More](#how-to-customize-assessment-core-report) about how to customize Assessment report.

The PowerBI template uses the generated discovery and assessment reports to generate the required business presentation which can be downloaded as PowerPoint.

Azure Migrate Explore also has capabilities to generate AI based summaries that can help users understand the migration recommendations, customer’s company profile and AI opportunities for the customers based on their profile, on-premises environment and assessment. The AI summary section also enables users to converse with AI to understand the details of the migration summary and get more information. Users can share more details and context to improve the summary generated. The summary generated can be exported as a .pdf file and used as a companion to the PowerPoint presentation.

## Azure Migrate Explore Assessment Report Generation Logic
The assessment logic for each type of workload is as below:
### SQL Assessment
SQL assessment is a three-step process:
  1. All the in-scope SQL instances are first assessed for Azure SQL Managed Instances. Details of SQL Server Instances that are ready for Azure SQL MI can be found in “SQL_MI_PaaS” tab in Assessment Core Report.
  2. The remaining SQL Instances that cannot be migrated to Azure SQL MI due to migration blockers (details of which are available in opportunity report) are then assessed for migration to SQL server in Azure VM (sizing the instance for Azure VM, using the recommended migration approach). Details of such SQL Server instances can be found in “SQL_IaaS_Instance_Rehost_Perf” tab in Assessment Core Report.
  Only Premium disks are recommended for Azure VMs that run SQL Instances on them.
  3. The remaining servers whose SQL instances are not ready for the above two migration/ modernization approaches are then assessed for readiness for SQL Server on Azure VM – using a Lift and Shift approach ie migrating an entire server not just individual SQL Server Instances running in them. Details of such SQL Server can be found in “SQL_IaaS_Server_Rehost_Perf” tab in Assessment Core report. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/concepts-azure-sql-assessment-calculation) about the SQL Server assessment logic.
### Web app Assessment
Web app assessment is a two-step process:
  1. All the in-scope discovered .NET Web apps running on IIS Web Servers on Windows Server are first assessed for migration to Azure App Service. Details of the Web app that are ready for Azure App service can be found in “WebApp_PaaS” tab in Assessment Core Report.
  2. The remaining servers whose web app/web apps cannot be migrated to Azure App Service due to migration blockers (details of which are available in opportunity report) are then assessed for Azure VM. Details of such server can be found in “WebApp_IaaS_Server_Rehost_Perf” tab in Assessment Core Report. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/concepts-azure-webapps-assessment-calculation) about the App Service assessment logic.
### Assessment of Servers containing SQL Services
All in-scope discovered machines  containing SQL Services such as SQL Server Integration services, SQL Server Reporting Services and SQL Server Analysis Services are assessed for migration to Azure VM – using a Lift and Shift approach. Details of such machines can be found in “VM_SS_IaaS_Server_Rehost_Perf” tab in Assessment Core Report.
### VM Assessment
The in-scope discovered Windows and Linux servers that do not have SQL Server, Web app, or SQL Services present on them are assessed for migration to Azure VM. Details of such machines can be found in “VM_IaaS_Server_Rehost_Perf” tab in Assessment Core Report. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/concepts-assessment-calculation) about the Azure VM assessment logic.
### AVS Assessment
The in-scope discovered machines that are running on VMware are assessed AVS assessment. AVS is an alternate approach to PaaS preferred migration where customer can choose to rehost their VMware environment on Azure VMware Services. Details of such machines can be found in “AVS_Summary” and “AVS_IaaS_Rehost_Perf” tab in Assessment Opportunity Core Report. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/concepts-azure-vmware-solution-assessment-calculation) about the AVS assessment logic.
### Azure Site Recovery and Backup
Azure Site Recovery and backup cost is only computed for the following workloads:
  - Machines and Instances running in Prod environment. 
  - Machines and Instances recommended for Migration to Azure VM.

## Generating migration summaries using AI

-	To generate migration summaries with AI, it is necessary to create all the previously mentioned reports based on your desired customization. 
- This includes gathering data from various sources, such as current system configurations, user feedback, and performance metrics, to ensure comprehensive coverage of the migration process.
- Once these reports are available, the "Generate summary with AI" tab will be enabled in the utility.
- Select that tab and answer a few basic questions to initiate the summary.
- The AI will use the context provided through the questionnaire and the reports generated from assessments to produce a three-section summary:
- Company profile: outlines the organization's background and objectives.
- Migration details: covers the specifics of the migration plan including timelines, resources, and expected challenges.
-	AI opportunities: identifies potential areas where AI can enhance the migration process or future operations.
-	To review the summary:
-	Go to the "Review Summary" tab where you will find three sections: Company profile, Migration details, and AI opportunities.

  ![Screenshot of AI summary generation.](./.media/)



## Customize reports
This article describes how to customize the generated reports to improve the usability and for easy access to the necessary information.

### Customize Discovery report
To customize, open the **Discovered_VMs** excel report which is generated at ```\AzMigExport\All_Discovered-VMs-Report\Discovered_VMs.xlsx```.
There are three types of customizations that a user can apply in discovery file:
1. Moving Servers out of Scope: VMs and machines that a customer doesn’t wish to migrate to azure can be moved out of scope for assessment and migration estimates.
The discovery file consists of details of discovered servers. Users can delete the required row in discovery file to move VM out of scope. Such VMs will not be considered for any type of assessment.
2. Limit Workload for respective assessment: If you want to avoid workloads like SQL Server or .NET WebApps to be considered for respective PaaS assessments, that is, Azure SQL MI and Azure App Service respectively, you can change the count in the respective column to 0; such workloads now will only be considered for migration to Azure VM via lift and shift.

   ![Screenshot of Discovery report.](./.media/discovery-report.png)

   For example, if a user does not want to assess the “Fabsqlsrv” machine for SQL Managed Instance but instead wants to rehost the server to Azure VM, then they should set the respective sqlDiscoveryServerCount to 0. 

   Similarly, if the user doesn’t wish to get a separate Azure VM recommended for a VM running Azure SQL Services, then they should set the respective sqlServicePresent to 0.

   Similarly, if a user does not want to assess the “Fabwebsrv1” machine for Azure App Service but instead wants to rehost the server to Azure VM, then they should set the respective WebappsCount to 0.

3.	Mark servers as Dev: Azure offers special discount pricing for machines in Dev/Test environment. You can categorize the servers into dev and prod environments by entering “Dev” and “Prod” in the **Environment Type** column in discovered report, so that adequate pricing considerations are applied at the time of assessment. Servers where environment type cells are blank are considered as production servers by default. 

### Customize Assessment Core report
Users can choose to customize Assessment Core Report for duplicates in assessment, removing servers out of scope and more. Cost Estimates in PowerBI are generated for only those machine rows that are part of Assessment Core Report and Assessment Opportunity report. 
Duplicates can be identified with the help of Clash report. [Learn More](#interpreting-clash-report) about interpreting Clash reports. By deleting the lines of a machine in respective assessment, users can choose to opt-out from getting recommendation and cost estimations.

For example 1: A Server (Contoso) has 3 SQL instances (A,B,C) running, as follows:
1. A is ready for Azure SQL MI (details available in “SQL_MI_PaaS” tab in Core report).
2. B is ready for Instance Rehost to Azure VM (details available in “SQL_IaaS_Instance_Rehost_Perf” tab in Core report).
3. C can neither be migrated to Azure SQL MI nor is ready for Instance rehost to Azure VM, AME recommends SQL Server rehost to Azure VM for such deployments. (details available in “SQL_IaaS_Server_Rehost_Perf” tab in Core report).

In such a scenario, a machine with 3 instances is considered in 3 assessments and would lead to duplicates. The Clash report highlights such scenarios and provides a count of recommended Target resources for each source machine in-scope. [Learn More](#interpreting-clash-report) about interpreting Clash reports.

Now suppose the user understands that Contoso is a Dev Server and wants to only do a Server rehost of such an SQL Server and chooses not to migrate its instances to PaaS. The user can delete rows of respective SQL Server and SQL Server instances from “SQL_MI_PaaS” and “SQL_IaaS_Instance_Rehost_Perf” tab in the Core report. The PowerBI will now only calculate the cost of Contoso Rehost to Azure VM.

For Example 2: Suppose a Webapp Server is running 2 Webapp (A and B), one of which is ready for migration to Azure App Service, However another is not. In that case, user will find this Web App server in both “WebApp_PaaS” and “WebApp_IaaS_Server_Rehost_Perf”. User can choose to only Server Rehost this Web App and should delete the required Server and Webapp row in “WebApp_PaaS” tab in Core report.

For Example 3: A Server is running both Webapp and SQL Server Instance, SQL Server Instance is ready for Azure MI but Webapp is not ready for Azure App Service, In such a case, this server will be recommended in “SQL_MI_PaaS” and  “WebApp_IaaS_Server_Rehost_Perf”. Now if the User decides to rehost the server and not take the SQL Instance to Azure SQL MI, the User should delete the respective row from “SQL_MI_PaaS” tab in the Core report.


### Customize PowerBI report
The PowerBI report consists of situational verbatims that need to be customized as per the required scenario. The User needs to click on the required text box and make the required changes as below:

 ![Screenshot of PowerBI report.](./.media/assessment-report.png)

> [!Note]
> You are requested not to change any number boxes as it may make your report prone to errors.

### As a Partner or Seller, I want to generate the presentation but want my customer to run the Module. Is that possible?
Yes. You can ask your customers to download the Azure Migrate Explore Utility Package and run Azure Migrate Explore. Once discovery and assessment is complete, your customer can send you the AzMigExplore folder with all the 4 discovery and assessment reports and PowerBI template. You may then run the PowerBI template by providing the required basepath. [Learn More](#how-do-we-find-the-basepath) on how to find basepath.

### If my VM is powered off, will I still get its assessment consideration?
Yes, it will be assessed for VM assessment only since its performance data will be unavailable.

### Connect-AzAccount is not recognized

#### Connect-AzAccount: The term ‘Connect-AzAccount’ is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program. 
#### Resolution
Check the spelling of the name or verify if the path, if included, is correct and try again. 

This error is a symptom of the Az.PowerShell module not being installed correctly. This may be due to the following reasons: 
1. AzureRM was installed and is creating conflicts with Az module. In this case, uninstall AzureRM. 
2. PowerShell version is older than 5.1. Please check the PowerShell version and update if needed. 
3. Run the [commands](README.md#run-following-commands-on-powershell-to-test-proper-installation) to verify proper installation of the modules. 

### Get-AzAccessToken is not recognized

#### Get-AzAccessToken: The term ‘Get-AzAccessToken’ is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program. 
#### Resolution
Check the spelling of the name or verify if the path, if included, is correct and try again. 

If Connect-AzAccount works and only Get-AzAccessToken returns the above error, this is because the latest version of Az.PowerShell module is not installed. To address this issue, follow these steps: 
1. Update the PowerShellGet module to the latest version. 
2. Install the latest version of Az PowerShell module (9.1.1). 
3. Run the [commands](README.md#run-following-commands-on-powershell-to-test-proper-installation) to verify proper installation of the modules.  

### General Troubleshooting 

For any other PowerShell module related error, or if the above errors were not resolved by following the steps mentioned below them, try this general Troubleshooting method: 
1. Ensure that the version and Execution policy prerequisites are met.
2. Install PowerShell v7 using the appropriate [msi installer package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.3#installing-the-msi-package).
3. Once the installation is complete, launch the PowerShell 7 terminal with Administrator privileges. 
4. Once PowerShell 7 terminal is started, run the commands to set Execution Policy and install Az PowerShell module mentioned above. 
5. Run the [commands](README.md#run-following-commands-on-powershell-to-test-proper-installation) to verify proper installation of the modules.  
6. Once it is verified that the commands are working as desired and the proper output is displayed on the PowerShell terminal, we need to add the path to the directory of these modules to PSModulePath environment variable. This can be achieved by following the steps below: 
   1. Run the following command on PowerShell 7 terminal. 

      ```powershell
      Get-Module -ListAvailable ‘Az.*’
      ```

      The directory to which these modules are referring to is displayed at the top of the output screen. 
   2. Copy the path of the directory as it is and close the PowerShell terminal. 
   3. Go to **Edit System Environment Variables** from the Start menu. 
   4. Select **Environment Variables**.
   5. Search for the *PSModulePath* variable in System Variables. 
   6. Double-click the *PSModulePath* variable. A dialog opens which contains all the paths assigned to that variable. 
   7. Select New and paste the path to the directory copied above. 
   8. Select the newly added path and select **Move Up** to increase its priority. 
   9. Select **Ok** where the path was added for the changes to take effect. 
   10. Select **Ok** again on the dialog with all the System Variables. 
   11. Select **Ok** again to close the **Edit System Environment Variables** dialog and for changes to take effect. 
   12. Run the older PowerShell terminal and run the commands to verify proper installation. 

### Test proper installation 

Run the following commands in the order specified. These are the commands run by the scripts to connect to the Azure Portal API and can help verify proper installation of the Az PowerShell module. 
1.	Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name ‘Az.*’ : This command lists all the PowerShell modules that should be installed as a part of Az PowerShell module and the directory they can be found in at the top. 
2.	Connect-AzAccount -Tenant <your_tenant_id> : This command prompts the user to sign in with their Microsoft account. 
3.	Set-AzContext -Subscription <your_subscription_id> : When run successfully, it displays the SubscriptionName, Account, and TenantID.
4.	Get-AzAccessToken -ResourceUrl ‘https://management.azure.com/’ : When run successfully, it displays the Token, ExpiresOn, Type, TenantID, and UserID.
